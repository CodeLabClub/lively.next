- fix scope visitor for new.target
## 0.7.40
- switching to new version of escodegen that fixes lively.vm/issues#6

## 0.7.38
- class transform: only use class holder for class declarations
- don't report export froms as undeclared refs
- add declaration wrapper to class def
- add declaration wrapper to assignment

## 0.7.30
- alternative class-to-function-transform that supports super getters and setters and doesn't require injecting the class object into methods

## 0.7.29
- transforming es6 classes so that declaring class gets passed into function when super call is needed (+ making sure that magic "arguments" array is properly fixed in those cases)



## 0.7.27
- objectSpreadTransform
- fixing class tests
- scope query: ensure resolveMap
- acorn-object-spread
- estree: obj spread support
- es6 classes: assign name to methods


## 0.7.26
- scope resolve references fix for export stmt with source
- safeResolveReferences -> resolveReferences
- query: finding decls for references without AST modifications
- class transform: optionally producing reference info that is passed into createOrExtendClass in order to track module context state via subscription to module changes

- node creation helpers: logical, ifStmt
- Merge pull request #6 from LivelyKernel/exports-not-resolved-by-default (only resolve exports when asked to)

## 0.7.24
- reverting to old knownGlobals for now as the removal of lively Globals causes trouble with the ObjectEditor

## 0.7.23
- build for fixing the freeze issues
- remove deepCopy because tree could have cycles


## 0.7.22

- findReferencesAndDeclsInScope: find this
- findReferencesAndDeclsInScope: find classes

## 0.7.20
- manual imports and exports (for eval) capture correctly

## 0.7.18
- don't shadow lexical bindings in class methods

## 0.7.17
- automatically applying classToFunction transform on rewriteToCaptureTopLevelVariables
- making class-to-function-transform work for export default + adding var decls automatically for class declarations
- moving eval support over to lively.vm

## 0.7.16
- capturing class expressions in assignments
- objectliteral creation helpr
- class to function transform
- objectLiteral helper

## 0.7.13
- disabling keeping values of var declarations for now (don't merge arbitrary expressions...!)

- capturing: fix wrapping destrucured vars
- eval transform wrap in func: pass last var decl into function as result

- 0.7.12
- fix rewriting classes (in combination with declaration wrappers)
- moving declarationWrapper logic and options.keepPreviouslyDeclaredValues processing from lively.vm into  eval-support.js

## 0.7.11
- fix for rewriteToRegisterModuleToCaptureSetters
- hoisting func decls and their catpures to the top of a scope

## 0.7.10
- ensure existing variables won't get undefined

## 0.7.8
- adding the ability to add an declarationWrapper to captured declarations, to inject a function call, e.g. for allowing lazy initialization. Works for classes, vars, and functions.

## 0.7.6
- replacing reduces with for loops for efficiency
- query/capturing: ignoring class expressions when gathering scope + rewriting, fixes LivelyKernel/lively.modules#8
