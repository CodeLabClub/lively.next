# flatn [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rksm/flatn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rksm/flatn)

flat node dependencies (flatn) is a nodejs package organizer that supports flat file system structures for nodejs package dependencies.  It is fully compatible with npm and provides an alternative for workflows where npm falls short.


## Rationale

npm installs package dependencies into node_modules folder inside of packages that require them.  The internal module resolve mechanism in nodejs then traverses the file system tree upward when it wants to load (require) one module from another one, looking into the node_modules folder to the matching package.

This has a number of negative consequences:
1. When you develop multiple packages that depend on each other you typically don't want them to be installed like normal dependencies but rather link the packages to each other.  `npm link` allows to do this but installs the links globally, so you cannot use multiple versions of you packages under development at the same time.

2. In the current npm version 4, linked packages (either symlinked by hand or via `npm link` sometimes seem to lead to very slow install / update operations, sometimes freezing the install / update process completely.

3. Local packages that depend on the same dependencies each install a seperate version of them, even when `npm link`ed.  Depending on how many packages you develop this can waste considerable disk space (gigabytes) and considerably slows down install / update processes.

4. Since npm version 3, npm tries to partially flatten out the dependency tree to avoid redundancies.  However, this has now the drawback that you cannot rely on the package.json dependency fields to find packages anymore deeper down in the tree.  You basically need to resolve packages via nodejs or use your own implementation of the npm lookup algorithm if you want to find packages with a different module system.  This complicates using node_modules especially in the browser context and with EcmaScript modules and System loaders such as SystemJS.

### Solution

To solve these problems, flattn can install packages in one or multiple shared directories that differ from the normal node_modules folders.  This directory / directories can either be local to your own packages or reside somewhere else on your file system.  This allows to minimize the number of installed packages and provides a reliable and simple mechanism to find packages:  Each package is stored with a folder name like package-name@version inside the specified directories

Packages under development can be separately specified.  Those packages will then be used, independently of what version they currently specify in their package.json to allow system wide "linking".

By importing `[module-resolver.js](module-resolver.js)` into your nodejs process and specifying the package directories via environment variables, nodejs will then use those directories when it tries to load modules.  Alternatively to manually importing `module-resolver.js` you can use `[bin/node](bin/node)` to start nodejs.

### Example

Let's say we have a local package `foo` with package.json

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "chalk": "^1"
  }
}
```

#### Install + require

We want to use a custom folder inside the projects directory to store the dependencies.  By running
```sh
$ mkdir deps
$ flatn --packages deps install
```

we install the "chalk" dependency inside the deps folder.  We can now set the `FLATN_PACKAGE_COLLECTION_DIRS` environment variable and run nodejs:
```sh
$ eval $( flatn --packages deps env )
$ node -p 'require("chalk").blue.bgRed.bold("it works!!!");'`
```

#### Using local packages without install

Let's say we have another module `bar` that is local and that we want to use from foo:

```sh
$ eval $( flatn --packages deps --dev-package /path/to/foo env )
$ node -p 'require("foo").doSomething(here)'`
```


## Command line usage

```
flatn â€“ flat node dependencies

Usage: flatn [generic args] command [command args]

Generic args:
  --packages / -C	Specifies a directory whose subdirectories are expected to be all packages ("package collection" dir)
  --dev-package / -D	Specifies a development package. Dev packages will always
                    	be built and will override all packages with the same name.  When a module
                    	requires the name of a dev package, the package will always match, no matter
                    	its version.
  --package/ -P	Specifies the path to a single package
(Repeat -C/-D/-P multiple times to specify any number of directories.)



Commands:
help		Print this help
list		List all packages that can be reached via the flatn package directories
    		specified in the environment and via generic arguments.

install		Usage without name: Downloads dependencies of the package in the
       		current directory and runs build tasks (with --save and --save-dev) also adds
       		to package.json in current dir
install name	Installs the package name in the first collection package dir
       		specified. With arguments --save or --save-dev it adds this package to the
       		dependencies or devDepedencies entry of the current package's package.json
node		Starts a new nodejs process that resolves modules usin the specified
    		package directories. To path arguments to nodejs use "--" followed by any
    		normal nodejs argument(s).

Environment:
Use the environment variables
  - FLATN_PACKAGE_COLLECTION_DIRS
  - FLATN_PACKAGE_DIRS
  - FLATN_DEV_PACKAGE_DIRS
to specify package directories.  The variables correspond to the -C, -P, and -D
generic arguments.  Use ":" to specify multiple directories, e.g.
FLATN_DEV_PACKAGE_DIRS=/home/user/package1:/home/user/package2.
Note: All directories have to be absolute.
