# flatn [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rksm/flatn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rksm/flatn)

flat node dependencies (flatn) is a nodejs package organizer that supports flat file system structures for nodejs package dependencies.  It is fully compatible with npm.


## Command line usage

```
flatn â€“ flat node dependencies

Usage: flatn [generic args] command [command args]

Generic args:
  --packages / -C	Specifies a directory whose subdirectories are expected to be all packages ("package collection" dir)
  --dev-package / -D	Specifies a development package. Dev packages will always
                    	be built and will override all packages with the same name.  When a module
                    	requires the name of a dev package, the package will always match, no matter
                    	its version.
  --package/ -P	Specifies the path to a single package
(Repeat -C/-D/-P multiple times to specify any number of directories.)
