# lively.serializer 2.0

Provides an object registry that continously tracks objects and is able to
snapshot the object graph or parts of it to serialize objects and their state.

Similarly, can re-create object (graphs) based on snapshots or update exising
registered object graphs when parts change.

These features provide the base for persistent lively.next workspaces and are
needed by [lively.sync](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.sync).
